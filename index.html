                <p>The current flow of our program is four weeks of a dedicated series on a relegious or social topic related to the teens, 
                    through the lens of a Catholic world view. In between these series we have social nights to promote lifeteen and to introduse 
                    those who don't regularly come.  </p>

                <h3>As Christians we make a descision to dedicate our lives to Christ, but sometimes we fail to keep him in the center of our lives. 
                    This retreat will focus on the four things St. Thomas Aquinas says That runs the risk of replacing God in our lives.
                    Those four things are Wealth, Power, Money, and Staus. Each night of our four week series will focus on one of these four things that replace God.
