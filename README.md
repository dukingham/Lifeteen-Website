# Lifeteen-Website
Website Project for St Marys Lifeteen
This is a website that will be both informative and unitive. 
I want people to be able to look at it and find what hey are looking for whether it be information on our next upcoming event, or understanding our mission and goals.
I also want it to be a place that others could create feed back. So, if nessicary, we can adapt our mission to the needs of those we serve.
